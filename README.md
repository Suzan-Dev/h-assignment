# Things to consider

1. Use React v17 as some packages were giving issues with React v18
2. Use vite's react-ts template instead of create-react-app
3. Use tailwindcss for styling
4. Use react-query for data fetching library

# Run Locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Use `yarn` command to install dependencies
3. Use `yarn dev` command to run in development mode
4. Use `yarn build` & then `yarn preview` to run in production mode

Happy Coding!
